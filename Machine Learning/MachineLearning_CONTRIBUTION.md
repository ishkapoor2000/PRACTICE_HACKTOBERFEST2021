<h1>Machine Learning</h1>

<p>Thanks for efforts & taking out the time to contributeðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥</p>

<p>I have created this repository with the intention to impart knowledge and to make this October a month of learning. We want all the contributors to choose a particular project/models/topic and provide all neccessary details required for it. The directory should be well-maintiained. You will take the credibility of your project and contributions. It is open to anyone in the global community! </p>


If you're a **Machine Learning** enthusiast :sunglasses: and want to add any project, models, predictions or snippet of code, your contributions are welcome!

When it comes to Artificial Intelligence domain, practice and analytical skills makes one **PRO**! Join us this Hacktoberfest ðŸŽŠ to practice and sharpen your AI & analysing skill and develop new projects. Work your way up through a self-choosen project that interest you. All that matters is making this October a month of learning and winning Schwags ðŸ‘•

<h2>
 What is Hacktoberfest2021 :thinking:? 
</h2>
Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean in partnership with Intel, Deespsource and Appwrite. Hacktoberfest encourages participation in the open source community, which grows bigger every year. Complete the 2021 challenge and earn a limited edition T-shirt. Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in the global community!

All that one must do is contribute to any open source project and send atleast 4 pull request between October 1 and October 31. It can be any project and you can contribute in any way possible. It can be a be a bug fix, improvement, feature addition  or even a documentation change! And win a T-Shirt and awesome stickers :star_struck:.

Inside Machine Learning, there are 4 different categories:

| Categories                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [ML](#machine-learning)                                       |
| [DL](#deep-learning)                                          |
| [NLP](#natural-language-processing)                           |
| [OpenCV](#open-computer-vision)                               |

### Machine Learning
Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. 
You can contribute to this repository via creating ML Projects, predictions, tutorials or theory for any particular topic, etc.
<br>
_Note_: Do not put project other than **ML** here, they should be pat of respective categories. Unrelated project in wrong directory will be rejected.

### Deep Learning
Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.
You can contribute to this repository via creating DL Projects, predictions, tutorials or theory for any particular topic, etc.
<br>
_Note_: Do not put **OpenCV** related project here, they should be pat of [OpenCV](#open-computer-vision).Unrelated project in wrong directory will be rejected.

### Natural Language Processing
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. The goal is a computer capable of "understanding" the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them.
<br>
_Note_: Do not put project other than **NLP** here, they should be pat of respective categories. Unrelated project in wrong directory will be rejected.

### Open Computer Vision
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. This library is cross-platform and free for use under the open-source Apache 2 License. It also supports model execution for Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.
<br>
_Note_: Do not put **DL** or any unrelated projects here, they should be pat of respective categories. Unrelated project in wrong directory will be rejected.

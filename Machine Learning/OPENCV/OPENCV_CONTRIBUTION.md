### Open Computer Vision
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. This library is cross-platform and free for use under the open-source Apache 2 License. It also supports model execution for Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.

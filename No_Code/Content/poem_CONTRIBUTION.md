<h3>poem on mother's day</h3>




she is the one who wakes for you
she is the one who prays for you 
she is the one who for whom you are everything
she is the one without whom u are nothing 

she's the one who we call in our need
she's the one who suffers for our greed
she's the one who stands for you like a wall 
she's the one whom you make  feel small

she's the one who will leave everything for you 
she's the one who will never make you feel out of the blue 
she's the one who is everyday  sacrificed 
she's the one whose heart is everyday vandalized 

she's the one she's the one 
but that's for you to decide  whoâ€™s she

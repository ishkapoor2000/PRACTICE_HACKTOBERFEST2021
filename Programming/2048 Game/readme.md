# Explanation_of_Code
I have created a Python version clone of [**2048 Game**](https://2048game.com/). I have used [**Tkinter**](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) module, to create standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) to play game in executable mode. It uses stacks and qeues concpet to store and add numbers in the grid. It also randomly adds numbers for the user on every move. Arrows keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) are used to move blocks in 2048 Game Window.
The file [colors.py](colors.py) stores all the colors and fonts used in main 2048 GUI.
